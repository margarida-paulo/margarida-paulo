### Hello, welcome to my Journey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Margarida Paulo, and I am currently a software development student in 42 Lisboa, and a Computing Engineer student in Universidade LusÃ³fona de Lisboa. I also have a degree in Fashion Design from the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Lisbon. I am currently working on learning as much as I can about coding and computing in general.
Coding was an unexpected passion that recently showed up in my life. Therefore, I'm looking forward to taking all the opportunities I can to improve this skill, and to make myself a better, more well-rounded professional in the field.
